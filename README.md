# Spendflix

Spendflix is a personal finance companion designed to help people take control of their money by understanding exactly where it goes each month. Focused on simplicity and real impact, it works by analyzing 3‚Äì6 months of bank statements (starting with Nubank), automatically categorizing most transactions, and offering clear, actionable insights. Whether you're chasing a dream or digging out of debt, Spendflix shows you how your spending habits align with your goals ‚Äî and what to do next.

This project also serves as a technical showcase for a modern, scalable architecture using a monorepo structure and microservices. It includes a web application built with React and Next.js (App Router), user authentication via AWS Cognito, serverless backend with AWS Lambda and API Gateway, and data persistence using PostgreSQL. The infrastructure is deployed with AWS Amplify, and development workflows are optimized with Cursor AI. The architecture is designed with maintainability and scalability in mind, following best practices like domain-driven design (DDD), background processing with queues (e.g., SQS), and modular service boundaries to support future growth.

   # Install jq
   choco install jq
   ```

7. Configure AWS CLI:
   ```powershell
   aws configure
   # Use any values for local development
   ```

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

1. Install nvm:

   ```bash
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sauloarruda/spendflix.git
   cd spendflix
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Run the setup script:

   ```bash
   pnpm run setup
   ```

   This will:

   - Create `.env.local` files from `.env.example` in both web and auth services
   - Set up Cognito for local development
   - Configure all necessary environment variables

### Available Scripts

- `pnpm dev` - Start all development servers
- `pnpm build` - Build all applications and services
- `pnpm test` - Run tests across all packages
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint across all packages
- `pnpm lint:fix` - Fix ESLint issues
- `pnpm format` - Format code with Prettier
- `pnpm generate:types` - Generate TypeScript types
- `pnpm setup` - Run initial setup (environment files and Cognito)
- `pnpm cognito:setup` - Set up Cognito user pool and client
- `pnpm cognito:start` - Start Cognito local emulator

## üîí Authentication

The authentication service uses AWS Cognito for user management. For local development, we use `cognito-local` to emulate Cognito functionality.

### Local Cognito Setup

1. First-time setup (creates user pool and client):

   ```bash
   pnpm cognito:setup
   ```

   This will:

   - Start cognito-local
   - Create a user pool named "SpendflixLocal"
   - Create a client named "local"
   - Save the pool and client IDs in `services/auth/.env.local`

   You can run this command anytime to reset your user pool to a fresh state.

2. Starting the auth service:
   ```bash
   cd services/auth
   pnpm dev
   ```
   This will:
   - Start cognito-local in the background
   - Start the serverless offline server
   - Automatically clean up cognito-local when the server stops

### Important Notes

- You only need to run `cognito:setup` once, but you can run it anytime to reset your user pool to a fresh state
- All cognito-local data is stored in `services/auth/.cognito`
- The confirmation code for all users is always `123123`

## üìù Code Quality

- ESLint for code linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- TypeScript for type safety
- Husky for git hooks
- Danger for automated code review
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
